<p>  One of the fundamental differences between the epidemic that attacked the world a hundred years ago and was called the “Spanish Flu,” and what the world is facing since the beginning of the current year 2020 with the emerging Corona virus, is the amount of huge data that rushes from official reports, and scientific studies related to virology and epidemiology in general, And the Corona virus family in particular, and the identification of the MERS and SARS viruses.

This is in contrast to the Big Data now available all around us, generated by users via social networks, communication networks, search engines, and many electronic transactions. As an example, it is possible to track the increasing number of searches day after day for symptoms of a disease on a search engine such as Google, which may serve as an indicator of the imminence of a particular epidemic in a region.

Data science combines three main bundles of science, skills, and knowledge, starting with statistics and mathematics, then programming skills, especially artificial intelligence and machine learning, and then knowledge related to the nature of the field whose data is monitored and analyzed.

The field of data science is one of the most in-demand fields in the labor market in the world during the past five years, and according to the report of the “Glassdoor” website, it is the most in-demand job in 2018 in the American market, which is also what LinkedIn’s annual report for 2017.

Perhaps the most prominent current efforts related to the employment of data science in the face of the emerging corona virus, the challenge launched by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in mid-March 2020, to build a huge open source data center CORD19, in which government institutions, academia, and technology companies participate, such as The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Library, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Cold Spring Laboratory, Georgetown University, as well as Google, Microsoft Research, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and dozens of other institutions.
